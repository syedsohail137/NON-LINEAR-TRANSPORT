    A self-calibrating C++ engine mapping asset variance matrices to option surface distributions using Garman-Klass volatility, dual OLS optimizations, and empirical transport grids.This document provides a comprehensive structural breakdown of the quantitative financial algorithm
implemented in the C++ framework. The system extracts underlying risk parameters from combined historical
spot distributions and real-time option chain matrices. It then calculates the empirical risk-neutral probability
density to evaluate non-linear structural distortion against classical log-normal asset distributions

## 🧐 About the Project

This repository provides a high-throughput, native quantitative execution environment built entirely from scratch in pure C++. The architecture reads raw historical underlying matrices and multi-strike option surfaces to extract risk-free rates, forward drift values, and implied volatility layers. It then leverages regularized finite differences combined with optimal transport metrics to extract robust price expectations (\(V^{*}\)) and tail distortion metrics without relying on any external BLAS, LAPACK, or statistical runtime software.

## 🔬 Architectural Pipeline

The codebase executes a precise three-stage pipeline to arrive at the targeted robust properties:


1. **Path Volatility Ingestion**: Ingests historical daily candles to calculate an unbiased annualized path variance using open, high, low, and close points.
2. **Put-Call Parity OLS Solver**: Translates call-minus-put strike arrays using linear regression to isolate risk-free rates (r) and continuous dividend/drift coefficients (d) natively.
3. **Transport Grid Alignment**: Solves a finite difference second derivative across strikes to establish the risk-neutral distribution, mapping it against a lognormal target model via distribution transportation layers.

## 🧮 Mathematical Framework

### 1. Localized Realized Volatility (Garman-Klass)
Utilizes the intraday path range to produce a minimum-variance estimator annualized over a standard 252-day business matrix:
\[\sigma_{ohlc} = \sqrt{\frac{252}{N} \sum_{t=1}^{N} \left[ 0.5 \left( \ln \frac{H_t}{L_t} \right)^2 - (2\ln 2 - 1) \left( \ln \frac{C_t}{O_t} \right)^2 \right]}\]

### 2. Native Parameter Calibration (OLS)
Applies linear regression to the option surface array by mapping strike differences against premium differences (\(Y_i = C_i - P_i\), \(X_i = -K_i\)). The continuous system rate and drift are then solved analytically:
\[r = -\frac{\ln(\text{slope})}{T}, \quad d = -\frac{\ln(\text{intercept} / S_0)}{T}\]

### 3. Implied Volatility Engine (Newton-Raphson)
Implements an optimized root-finding method leveraging a native error function complement (erfc) to reverse-engineer ATM Implied Volatility (σ):
\[\sigma_{n+1} = \sigma_n - \frac{BS_{call}(\sigma_n) - C_{target}}{\mathcal{V}(\sigma_n)}\]

### 4. Transport Distribution & Robust Expectation (\(V^{*}\))
Extracts empirical risk-neutral mass (\(\mu_T\)) by applying a regularized finite difference operator weighted by open interest log-growth, then establishes a lognormal target distribution (\(\nu_t\)) to track divergence boundaries:
\[\mu_{T, i} = \max\left(\frac{C_{i+1} - 2C_i + C_{i-1}}{(\Delta K)^2}, 0\right) \cdot e^{rT} \cdot (1 + 0.05\ln(\text{OI}_{total} + 1))\]
\[V^* = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mu_{T, i} \cdot K_i\]

## 🚀 Compilation & Execution

Because the implementation uses pure C++ standard library parts, compilation is fast and cross-platform.

### Linux / macOS
```bash
# Navigate to the workspace containing your source and text matrices
cd generated

# Compile with high optimization and vectorization switches
g++ -O3 -std=c++17 engine.cpp -o transport_engine

# Execute the binary
./transport_engine
```

### Windows (MSVC Core Developer Command Prompt)
```cmd
cl /EHsc /O2 /std:c++17 engine.cpp /fe:transport_engine.exe
transport_engine.exe
```
